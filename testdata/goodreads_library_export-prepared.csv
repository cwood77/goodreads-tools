It is so bad I actually got angry near the end at having my time wasted.  Somewhere on the back cover or in a review somewhere it was stated that the novel dives deeper into the story that I liked in the film.  It does not.  I think, quite the opposite: it spells out explicitly how devoid of explanation and meaning the storyline really is.  What you may have been willing to grant the film in the way of ambiguity is unmasked plainly as underdevelopment in the novel.  It feels like something from a middle school creative writing summer camp.  Whole chunks of the text devolve into indecipherable hippy nonsense.<br/><br/>I've read books that were better than their film adaptations, and books that were worse, but I've never read a book so terrible as to make be doubt the directorial competence of its author.",,,1,0
